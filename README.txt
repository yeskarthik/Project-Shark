please note:
1) the cpp files are to be pasted in the INCLUDE directory of TC
2)the music files are to be pasted in the BIN directory of TC
3)the main programs are 
->menu1.cpp
&
->menu2.cpp

4)change the graphics driver location accordingly in the initgraph 
command in the program.

Project Shark Consists of various Games  and Mathematical Realisation activities.

Maths

3D graphing using Sin, Cos, Tan, Log
3D model of the universe with Animation
Roots : To find a roots of a very large N degree equation
SinCos : To Draw Sin, Cos, Tan graphs in 2D according to given frequency and Amplitude
PieBar : To Draw Pie Chart and Bar Graph using the given values
Primes : To find the prime factors of a given number.

Games 

Bally : A Game using the angles and reflection as the concept where similar colour balls if collected vanish and the game is over if all the balls are done.

FlyBall : A game in which a ball keeps falling down and there will be Horizontal rectangles which keep coming up with limited width with various speeds according to the level. The ball is controlled with the arrow keys. And the goal is to escape the rectangular balls and reach the end of the screen.

Puzzle : Is similar to the game existing in Gcompris, where numbers are arranged in a random order with one hole in a square and the goal is to arrange them in Order using the empty space . (The Fifteen Game).


Activities

Piano : A 3 octet keyboard with the black and white keys returning a specific note mapped to specific keyboard keys. (As i mentioned in the previous mail)

Paint : A full fletched Paint application with 32 colours, shapes, pens, copy paste feature, save feature. Did not use existing image compression but used the pixel position and colours to save the image. Worked really well.
